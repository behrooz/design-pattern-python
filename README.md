Design patterns in Python, as in any other programming language, provide reusable solutions to common software design problems. Python supports a wide range of design patterns. Here are some of the most commonly used design patterns in Python:

# Singleton Pattern: 
Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Often used for managing global configurations or resources.

# Factory Method Pattern:
Provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Commonly used in libraries and frameworks to create objects without specifying their exact classes.

# Observer Pattern:
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing one object (the subject) to notify its observers of state changes. Commonly used in event handling and GUI frameworks.

# Decorator Pattern:
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Useful for extending the behavior of classes without modifying their source code.

# Strategy Pattern:
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Useful for selecting and switching between different algorithms at runtime.

# Command Pattern:
Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with requests. Used for implementing undo/redo functionality and queuing requests.

# Adapter Pattern:
Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. Used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

# Template Method Pattern:
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps. Commonly used for defining the structure of algorithms and letting subclasses provide concrete implementations.

# Iterator Pattern:
Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. Commonly used for iterating over collections and data structures.

# Composite Pattern:
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Useful for treating individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
